# orbitation-around-sun
It is jQuery application; the way I saw an object orbiting around sun. I saw sun that morning very first time with an object moving around it. I thought to make something similar to the way I saw in jQuery. It is simple jQuery animamtion with different rotational degrees; tries to cover how an object orbits around the sun. Personally for me it is life after death matter; I was seeing that earth orbiting around sun that I left. I still live the same place; but I think it photocopies naturally an earth; the way we photocopy by machine; certainly machine is made with natural scientific rules. Rainbow can be the best example of computers; we can say rainbow is first computer (video in the air). That earth was close to the sun; so Multan is known as the hottest place on earth. As per my understanding rotational degree of orbiting object around sun is the same way; the way it is written in Quran in Chapter Waqiath (O Paradise People); means it orbits on the right hand side nob; for example the way wall clock needle is on the first minute. This jQuery application can be helpful for the learners learning jQuery Aniamtion; watching this also return peaceful sleep. I have used pure binaries 1010 with jQuery animation and it is simple basic computing. One can contact me at altariqpulsar01@gmail.com. It is a .php file; you can use XAMPP to run it or any other webserver that is available to you.
